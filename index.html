            <p>By the 1880s, the Indigenous peoples of the Plains in the West were facing a disaster. These groups
                included the Cree, Siksika, Kainai, Piikani, and Saulteaux. The buffalo disappeared entirely from the
                plains in Canada. They had once flourished in the millions in the early 19th century. The Indigenous
                peoples of the Plains began to starve, as the buffalo was their primary food. This disappearance of the
                buffalo wasn't natural. The lucrative robe trade encouraged white settlers and Indigenous peoples to
                overhunt the plains bison. Additionally, westward migration destroyed grazing grounds and introduced new
                diseases.</p>

An unknown photographer took the photo outside of Michigan Carbon Works in Rougeville. The bison population exceeded 60 million in the late 18th century, but the species was hunted down to less than 600 by 1890. This rapid slaughter of buffalo was accelerated when an efficient tanning method was developed, allowing for the hide of the buffalo to be hardened into leather. Buffalo bones could also be processed for fertilizer. The invention of the repeating rifle allowed hunters to hunt large numbers of buffalo. Some hunters killed buffalo for economic gains, like fur traders, while others did it for sport.', 'images/bison_skull_pile.jpg')">

            <p>After Canada acquired the Hudson's Bay Company's territory (Rupert's Land), many Indigenous groups signed
                treaties to prevent starvation. In return for reserve lands, money, and protection, their lands were
                ceded to Canada. These treaties ended their traditional nomadic way of life, forcing them to turn to
                agriculture instead. The Indigenous peoples watched as farms, railways, and towns appeared on the
                prairies in the late 19th century.</p>

Treaty 2 was signed on August 21, 1871, at Manitoba Post by the Anishinaabe of southern Manitoba. These treaties aimed to assimilate Indigenous peoples into the Euro-Canadian society, taking away their previous ways of life. The treaties provided small reserves and annual financial support for the Indigenous peoples but ceded large amounts of land in present-day southern Manitoba and Saskatchewan to Canada.', 'images/treaty_map.png')">

The territory ceded to Canada, which amounted to more than 300 000 square kilometers, extended across the central regions of present-day Alberta and Saskatchewan, including the current location of Edmonton. Even as early as 1871, the Plains Indigenous peoples were interested in negotiating a treaty that would protect them from settlement. Initially, the Canadian Government was not interested, but after the Cree refused to let any settlers into their unceded territory, negotiation began. A young Cree chief named Poundmaker argued that the settlers had no right to the land, but in the end, most of the plains chiefs signed Treaty 6. The Canadians offered better terms than in the previous treaties, such as protection from famine and better education on the reserves.', 'images/treaty6.jpg')">

            <p>The treaties did not solve the Native peoples' problems. In the winter of 1884, an estimated one-tenth of
                the plains Indigenous peoples died from starvation, malnutrition, and disease. The now-scarce buffalo
                had provided their food, clothing, and shelter. Eventually, they became dependent on government rations.
                The government would sometimes cut rations to twist them into signing treaties. In 1880, the chiefs Big
                Bear and Crowfoot formed a confederacy to solve these problems.</p>

            <p>On June 16, 1884, the Cree chief Mistahimaskwa (Big Bear) hosted a gathering. More than 2000 Cree people
                attended. After a young warrior named Kawicitwemot assaulted a farmer for denying him food, the
                North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) arrived. 400 Cree warriors met the police. Mistahimaskwa managed to
                defuse the situation, allowing the police to apprehend Kawicitwemot peacefully. This incident compelled
                the Canadian government to send more police to the West, fearing a conflict.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the Métis had their grievances. After the Red River Rebellion in 1870, many settled in the
                Fort Carlton region, founding several settlements on the South Saskatchewan River. Their lives as fur
                traders were impacted by the near-extinction of the buffalo, so they were dependent on these lands for
                sustenance. In 1883, the government sold one of their villages to the Prince Albert Colonization
                Company. The Métis believed that the government was not respecting their land, farms, and homesteads.
                Furthermore, many of them felt that the government was not protecting their rights and identity.</p>

            <p>On March 24, 1884, a group of Métis in Batoche decided that Louis Riel should return from exile and
                represent their cause. On May 6, in a meeting attended by the Métis and sympathetic white
                representatives from Prince Albert, they decided to send a delegation to ask Riel to return. Riel
                arrived in Manitoba on July 4. He encouraged the people of the North-West to unite and press their case
                on the federal government, and in Ottawa, the Conservative government began to fear a second rebellion.

        <div class="artifact">
            <p>In December 1884, Riel drafted a petition to the government. In return, the government offered little
                more than an investigation into Métis land claims. Unhappy with the government's response, the Métis set
                up a provisional government on March 18 and seized the parish church at Batoche, demanding the surrender
                of the nearby Fort Carlton. Riel became the president, while hunter and tactician Gabriel Dumont became
                their military commander.</p>

            <p>On March 25, 1885, Dumont brought 30 men to gather supplies from a store near the community of Duck Lake.
                Meanwhile, the superintendent of the NWMP, Leif Crozier, received word that the Métis were planning to
                occupy Duck Lake, unaware that this had already happened. He sent fifteen police and seven armed
                volunteers to get provisions from the store. Dumont and his warriors intercepted the police, and the
                Canadians returned to Fort Carlton, not wanting to risk a physical engagement. Crozier returned with a
                force of fifty-six police and forty-three volunteers to take supplies from the store.</p>

        <div class="artifact">
            <p>In the early morning of March 26, Dumont set up an ambush outside Duck Lake, but some of Crozier's scouts
                were aware of his plan. Crozier's men prepared a mounted barricade, and the Métis formed a semi-circle
                to attack the police on both flanks. Dumont sent his brother Isidore and a chief named Assiwiyin with a
                white flag to distract Crozier's forces, but the police shot both of them. The Métis began to fire from
                all sides. The police retreated into a clearing, where the Métis ambushed them. Dumont was wounded by a
                bullet but stayed to motivate his men. Within half an hour, Crozier ordered a retreat. The police fled,
                and although Dumont's brother Édouard wanted to pursue them, Riel ordered a stop to the bloodshed. The
                Métis had five casualties while the police had twelve. Colonel Irvine, Crozier's superior, decided to
                evacuate and destroy Fort Carlton on March 28, and they moved to Prince Albert.</p>

                April 2, they took federal Indian agent Thomas Quinn and several other white settlers hostage. The Cree
                ordered the prisoners to go to their encampment. When Quinn refused, they shot him in the head. Despite
                Big Bear's attempts to stop the massacre, the band killed another eight unarmed settlers, including two
                priests. Seventy others from the town were taken captive. One of the men, a clerk named William
                Bleasdell Cameron, escaped with the help of sympathetic Cree, who sheltered him at their camp. Then,
                they burned the church. This event became known as the Frog Lake Massacre.</p>

            <p>On April 15, 200 Cree warriors attacked Fort Pitt. They intercepted a police party, killing a constable
                and wounding another. The garrison commander Francis Dickens (son of Charles Dickens) surrendered. Big
                Bear released the police officers but kept the townspeople hostage. Then, the Cree destroyed the fort.

            <p>The government's reaction was decisive. On March 25, 1885, militia mobilization began, even though there
                were only a few hundred full-time Canadian soldiers. 300 Canadian troops were transported across the
                unfinished gaps of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and they arrived at Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan, on April
                10. Most were Ontarians, but there were also three battalions from Quebec and Nova Scotia. There were an
                additional 1700 troops from the West, totaling around 5000 under the command of General Frederick
                Middleton.</p>

            <p>Middleton's troops left Qu'Appelle on April 10 and advanced upstream along the South Saskatchewan River.
                The scouts discovered an apparent ambush by Dumont's Métis and Dakota force at Fish Creek. The Métis
                decided to attack Middleton's forces at Tourond's Coulée, a nearby ravine. Dumont brought 200 fighters
                with him to the site. Meanwhile, Middleton set up a camp on a farm 10 kilometers south of Fish Creek.
                The next day, as Middleton's militia attempted to cross the ravine, a scout noticed the tracks of an
                inexperienced Métis soldier and followed them. The scout approached Dumont and his men, but before he
                could catch the scout, the Métis and Canadians had met, and the ambush began. Dumont shot the scout and
                returned to the rifle pits.</p>

            <p>After the ambush, the Métis withdrew into cover and switched to sniping to conserve ammunition. Half of
                Middleton's force was on the other side of the river, and his artillery fire on the Métis had little
                effect, although it drove their Cree allies away. Many Métis soldiers wanted to flee, as they were
                vastly outnumbered, but Dumont convinced them to stay. The Canadians weren't making much progress, and
                with casualties mounting, they undertook several rushes into the ravine, which only succeeded in causing
                more deaths. When the sun began to set, Middleton opted for retreat. Although outnumbered, the Métis

                the Cree. They arrived on April 24 and found hundreds of civilians crammed into the fort, but not any of
                Poundmaker's men. Pressured by the civilians and his troops, Otter decided to take action. He received
                permission to "punish Poundmaker" and set out with cavalry, militia, volunteers, and two field rifles

                waded through the marsh. An old Cree man awoke when he heard the sound of soldiers and alerted the
                others. Otter's cannons destroyed the camp's lodges, and the women and children ran towards the ravines
                for safety. Assiniboine warriors charged at Otter's men to defend the women and children. The Canadians
                formed a wedge, with two lines of soldiers and police facing the ravines while the volunteers and
                militia guarded the rear, facing the marsh. The Cree employed a flanking maneuver, stealthily moving
                towards the soldiers. They almost encircled Otter's men. Finally, the Canadians chose to withdraw
                through the marsh. As they retreated, some of the Cree fighters mounted their horses. Poundmaker
                convinced his men to let them leave.</p>

            <p>On May 7, Middleton reached Gabriel's Crossing and advanced to within 13 kilometers of Batoche. Middleton
                planned to encircle the Métis by unloading troops at the rear of the town by a steamboat named
                Northcote. However, the steamboat arrived before the planned attack, and the Métis sliced off its masts
                and smokestacks by lowering the ferry cable. On May 9, Middleton approached the church at Mission Ridge,
                unaware that the steamboat was damaged. After finding only priests, nuns, women, and children, they
                advanced to shell the town.</p>

                attacked the Canadian artillery, but they fired at the attackers. The Métis then attempted to outflank
                the militia, resulting in heavy fighting. In the afternoon, the artillery bombarded the rifle pits to no
                avail. Towards the end of the first day, Middleton ordered the Canadians to retire into temporary

            <p>On May 10 and 11, Middleton made heavily defended gun-pits and shelled the town. The Métis' heavy fire
                prevented attempted Canadian advancements. To test the enemy's strength, Middleton dispatched a group of
                men north. At the same time, he conducted an assault at the front. The Métis redirected some of their
                forces to hold off the northward flank and did not have the necessary power to oppose the central
                assault. The Canadians were able to make it as far as the Batoche cemetery before turning back.
                Middleton, satisfied with the result, planned to assault the town the next morning using this method.

                hunting for bullets fired by the Canadians. Three-quarters were wounded. Meanwhile, Middleton enacted
                his plan, leading his group north to distract the Métis while Colonel van Straubenzee led the main
                assault. However, van Straubenzee failed to hear the gunfire from the north and did not attack.</p>

            <p>After the failed assault, the senior Canadian officers, angry with Middleton's caution, decided to rush
                straight at the Métis' rifle pits. Many Métis soldiers were too far to help because of Middleton's
                diversion, and those who remained did not have enough ammunition, but they resisted bravely. The
                charging Canadian militia stormed into Batoche as the diverted Indigenous fighters returned. They fired
                at the Canadians from rifle pits near the village. However, the Canadian charge was too overwhelming,
                and the last defenders of Batoche surrendered. Straubenzee's soldiers drove out the remaining Métis from

            <p>Although the Battle of Batoche had virtually ended the Rebellion, some small battles occurred after. The
                first was the Battle of Frenchman's Butte. On May 14, a group of men led by General Strange left
                Edmonton and caught up to the Frog Lake Cree at Frenchman's Butte. The Cree dug in at the top of a steep
                hill. Directly advancing towards the Cree would have been difficult, so instead, they opted to fire from
                long range for several hours. Eventually, both sides retreated. The second was the Battle of Loon Lake.
                On June 3, a group of police and fighters led by Major Sam Steele attacked a group of Plains Cree
                warriors and saved a group of hostages. The Cree suffered 5-12 casualties, and the Canadians captured
                Wandering Spirit.</p>

                prison in Regina to await trial. He was charged with six counts of high treason, which carried a

                Justice of Alberta and the Attorney General of Quebec. Riel could not afford defence lawyers, so
                supporters in Quebec provided funds. Charles Fitzpatrick, who later became the Chief Justice of Canada,

            <p>Riel's lawyers argued that he was mentally unstable, hoping that Riel would be acquitted by reason of
                insanity. He had been sent to mental asylums in Quebec twice, and it was said that a few of his writings
                showed signs of megalomania. Riel objected to using this defence, declaring that he did not suffer from
                mental health issues. Instead, he argued that his actions were justified. The prosecution argued that
                Riel commited high treason as the sole leader of the Rebellion. They also called in medical witnesses to
                refute the argument of insanity.</p>

        <div class="artifact">
            <p>On the last day of Riel's trial, the two sides made their closing arguments. The defence lawyers outlined
                the historical role of the Métis, then argued that Riel's actions could not be a sane man's. Riel then
                delivered a lengthy speech defending his actions and the rights of the Métis. He dismantled his lawyers'
                argument for insanity, claiming that he was perfectly sane. Finally, Riel denounced the Government of
                Canada for its disregard for the people in the West. He hoped to be recognized as a force of good
                eventually. After the prosecution's summary speech, the jury found him guilty but recommended mercy.
                However, the judge sentenced him the death, the only possible punishment under the Treason Act. The
                defence attempted to appeal the verdict twice to higher courts but failed, and a medical examination of
                Riel's alleged insanity had an ambiguous result. The government was flooded with petitions to save Riel,
                but he was hung on November 16.</p>

            <p>The Rebellion resulted in the collapse of the provisional government, the subjugation of the Plains

                of Western Canada to recover politically. The government provided land grants to the Saskatchewan Métis
                and resurveyed the Métis river at their wish, but they still did not have  equality. Riel's trial caused
                upset among French Canadians, contributing to the distrust of Anglophones in Quebec that still exists

                            French people, an act of cruelty against a supporter of rights for French Catholics. To
                            them, the hanging represented a Canada where French Canadians' views and feelings could be
                            disregarded. The hanging of Riel was first in a series of events that led to the rise of
                            Quebec separatism. Riel's execution tarnished the reputation of the Conservative Party in
                            Quebec. It became known as "le parti des Anglais" (the party of the English). Some
                            politicians rose to power by publicly expressing these opinions.</p>

            <p>Riel's execution sparked outrage across French Canada. Six thousand protesters gathered in the streets
                of Montréal. A few weeks later, on November 23, an organized rally of fifty thousand protesters gathered
                in the Champ de Mars. Wilfred Laurier, who later became the first francophone prime minister of Canada,
                spoke at the rally. Some historians believe that this speech was the first step towards his rise to power.
                The outrage over Riel's execution also tarnished the reputation of the Conservative Party in Quebec,
                which led to the first majority Liberal government in Quebec in 1886.

            <p>The Rebellion had a distinct regional impact in the West. A wave of Canadian nationalism spread across
                western settler communities, based on the universal 'threat' of the armed Indigenous insurgency. This
                would help Canada reaffirm its sovereignty over the west.</p>

            <p>The North-West Rebellion contributed to the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The
            president of the CPR, Sir William Cornelius Van Horne, asked the government for funds in return for
            providing quick transportation of the Canadian troops to the west. The government accepted, and after
            the Rebellion was quelled, they provided the necessary funds and re-organized the CPR's debt. This

            <p>After the Rebellion, the Métis and some groups of First Nations suffered from discrimination.
                An era of systemic marginalization of Indigenous peoples began in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
                The homes of the Métis were plundered by soldiers. Many Métis people were dispersed, and those
                who stayed were increasingly marginalized. The children or grandchildren of participants of the
                Rebellion had to pay a fee to enter Catholic schools. It wasn't until decades later that the
                government began to address the political, social, societal, and economic marginalization of
                the Métis in the west.</p>

            <p>The Rebellion is sometimes considered a Resistance by historians. A resistance tends to be more passive
                than a rebellion, while a rebellion is about overthrowing. This is because the Indigenous peoples
                governed the land long before the Canadian government did, and the uprisings were merely reactions
                against Canada's control.</p>

            <h1>Poundmaker's Exoneration</h1>
            <p>On May 23, 2019, Justin Trudeau exonerated Chief Poundmaker, stating that
                <blockquote>It was here that Chief Poundmaker made his indelible mark on history. Here that he earned
                    his well-deserved reputation as a diplomat and peacemaker. Here that he stood up for his people and
                    demonstrated compassion in the face of persecution. <i>[...]</i> Fuelled by mistrust and a lack of
                    understanding, government officials held Chief Poundmaker, as the recognized leader of his people,
                    responsible for the actions of his community and convicted him of treason-felony in August
                    1885. <i>[...]</i> Today, our government acknowledges that Chief Poundmaker was a peacemaker who
                    never stopped fighting for peace. <i>[...]</i> The Government of Canada recognizes that Chief
                    Poundmaker was not a criminal, but someone who worked tirelessly to ensure the survival of his
                    people, and hold the Crown accountable to its obligations as laid out in Treaty 6. We recognize that
                    the unjust conviction and imprisonment of Chief Poundmaker had, and continues to have, a profound
                    impact on the Poundmaker Cree Nation. <i>[...]</i> And so, as an important symbol of our desire to
                    revitalize our relationship with the Poundmaker Cree Nation, I'm here today on behalf of the
                    Government of Canada to confirm without reservation that Chief Poundmaker is fully exonerated of any
                    crime or wrongdoing.

            <p>Meanwhile, the subject of Louis Riel's exoneration is one of debate. Those who argue against it claim
                that it will do nothing good, and that an exoneration would merely an act of political expediency.</p>

            <h1>Métis Rights</h1>
            <p>The fight for Métis rights still continues today. Métis are still not considered status Indians, and
                cannot claim all of the benefits that status Indians can. These benefits may include on-reserve housing,
                on-reserve education, and exemptions from taxes in specific situations. Recent legal cases are making
                advancements in Métis rights. For example, on April 14, 2016, in the case Daniels v. Canada (2016), the
                Supreme Court ruled that the Crown owes the same fiduciary duty to Métis as it does to Treaty Indians.
                Additionally, some Métis groups are fighting for the right to self-government. </p>
